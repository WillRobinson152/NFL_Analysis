<h1>NFL Analysis</h1>
<p>
  This is the second of two capstone projects for the <a href="https://bootcamprankings.com/springboard-data-science-career-track/">Springboard Data Science Career Track</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The requirements for this project were as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Business Insider track: come up with a project intended to deliver business insights and recommendations. You will use the business analytics techniques and advanced visualization skills you learn in this track to create a comprehensive and actionable capstone project.
</li>
  <li>Find and wrangle data</li>
  <li>Use exploratory data analysis techniques to understand that data</li>
  <li>Pre-process and create a training dataset</li>
  <li>Build a working model</li>
  <li>Document and present your work</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For this project, I chose to explore traits of NFL athletes that might help an NFL GM or owner allocate their salary cap to the greatest affect. I completed this project in April 2021.
