    "The NFL is becoming a passing-dominated league. Passing attempts, yards and touchdowns have been outpacing rushing attempts, yards and touchdowns for decades, and the gaps are widening.\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy appears to yield better offenses. While passing yards have increased steeply, rushing yards have been mostly flat - meaning passing yards are not making up for lost rushing yards, but rather total yards are increasing. Similarly, both passing and rushing touchdowns have increased in recent years, again suggesting that the increasing focus on passing has not come at the expense of rushing.\n",
